# Mental Health Support Survey Data Analysis

## Introduction
In this analysis, we are working with a dataset that captures survey responses related to the current state of mental health support at various universities. The dataset includes both quantitative (e.g., mental health ratings) and qualitative (e.g., suggestions for improvement) data, allowing us to explore the distribution of responses and extract insights into how students perceive the mental health resources provided by their institutions.

The survey touches upon several important aspects, including:
- **Gender and Field of Study**: Demographic details of the respondents.
- **Current State of Mental Health Support**: Ratings on a scale of 1 to 5.
- **Concerns about AI-powered mental health applications**: Respondents' concerns about privacy, misinformation, and other issues.
- **Suggestions for Improving Mental Health Support**: Open-ended feedback from respondents on how universities can improve their mental health resources.

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to perform both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data. We aim to:
1. Understand the demographic distribution of respondents, including their gender and field of study.
2. Analyze the distribution of mental health support ratings to evaluate the general satisfaction level among students.
3. Examine common concerns related to AI-powered mental health companion applications.
4. Explore and categorize the suggestions provided by respondents for improving mental health support.
5. Generate meaningful visualizations to represent the key findings and patterns in the data.

## Qualitative Analysis Techniques
The qualitative analysis methods applied in this notebook include:
- **Thematic analysis**: Grouping responses based on recurring themes or topics, especially for open-ended text responses such as concerns and suggestions.
- **Sentiment analysis**: Using NLP tools to determine the emotional tone of the textual feedback.
- **Categorization**: Manually classifying suggestions into broader categories for better understanding.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the most frequent terms in respondents' feedback to identify important themes.
- **Cross-tabulation**: Comparing different demographic groups to see how their responses vary.

Through this analysis, we aim to extract actionable insights into how universities can better support the mental health of students.
